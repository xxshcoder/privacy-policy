            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes to provide, maintain, and improve QuizX. Below are the primary ways we use your personal and non-personal information:</p>
            <h3>2.1 To Provide and Operate the App</h3>
            <p>Your name is displayed on the App's leaderboard to showcase your quiz rankings and foster a competitive environment. The leaderboard is a core feature of the App, allowing users to see how they perform compared to others. Your email address is used to link your quiz scores, progress, and account activities to your unique profile, ensuring a personalized experience.</p>
            <p>We process your personal information to authenticate your identity during sign-in, manage your account, and deliver the App's core functionalities. For example, when you complete a quiz, your score is associated with your account and reflected on the leaderboard under your name.</p>

            <h3>2.2 To Communicate with You</h3>
            <p>We may use your email address to send you important updates, such as changes to the App, updates to this Privacy Policy, or responses to your inquiries. These communications are limited to essential information and are not used for marketing purposes unless you explicitly opt in to receive promotional content (if applicable).</p>

            <h3>2.3 To Improve and Analyze the App</h3>
            <p>We use non-personal information, such as usage data and aggregated analytics, to understand how users interact with the App. This helps us identify popular features, detect technical issues, and develop new quizzes or functionalities. For example, we may analyze which quiz categories are most popular to create more engaging content.</p>
            <p>Personal information, such as your name and email address, is not used for analytics unless it is anonymized and aggregated with other users' data. This ensures that your identity remains protected while we gain insights to enhance the App.</p>

            <h3>2.4 To Ensure Security and Compliance</h3>
            <p>We use your information to monitor and prevent unauthorized access, fraud, or abuse of the App. For instance, we may use your email address to verify your identity if you request account deletion or report a security issue. We also use device information to detect and address potential security threats, such as suspicious login attempts.</p>
            <p>In addition, we may use your information to comply with legal obligations, such as responding to lawful requests from regulatory authorities or maintaining records as required by applicable data protection laws.</p>
